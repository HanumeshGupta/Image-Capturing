# Image-Capturing
Image Capturing is the Machine learning process in which you have to train your model to learn from image... Here we use transfer model of LSTM.

Image capturing and description play a crucial role in various fields, including computer vision, photography, and artificial intelligence. Letâ€™s explore the basics:

# Image Acquisition:
Image acquisition involves capturing an image using various devices such as digital cameras, scanners, or importing existing images into a computer.
Digital cameras use image sensors (such as CCD or CMOS) to detect the energy emitted by the object, converting it into a digital image1.
# Image Description:
Image description refers to creating detailed information about visual objects, image metadata, or entities present in an image.
In computer vision, image captioning algorithms generate textual descriptions for images, making them more accessible and informative
